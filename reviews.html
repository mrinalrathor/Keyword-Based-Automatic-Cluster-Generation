    <h2>Review 1</h2>
    <p>These shoes are amazing! They provide great comfort and support during long runs. 
        I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good running shoe. 
        The size was perfect and the color looks even better in person. 
        A bit pricey, but definitely worth the investment.</p>

    <h2>Review 2</h2>
    <p>These shoes are a disappointment. The soles are very slippery, 
        which makes them unsafe for outdoor use. The material feels cheap 
        and they started to fall apart after just a few weeks. Not happy with 
        this purchase at all. I would not recommend them.</p>

    <h2>Review 3</h2>
    <p>These basketball shoes are fantastic! The ankle support is excellent 
        and they provide great traction on the court. I've been using them for 
        several months now and they're still holding up well. True to size 
        and very comfortable for playing for extended periods. A bit on the 
        heavy side, but the performance outweighs that.</p>

    <h2>Review 4</h2>
    <p>I bought these shoes for casual wear, but they're not very comfortable. 
        The inner sole is thin and offers no cushioning. The style is nice, 
        but they're not practical for everyday use. Disappointed with the 
        quality considering the price. Might be okay for occasional wear, 
        but not for walking long distances.</p>
